# Beginning Haskell

As a Math teacher, I started with JavaScript to implement a website for teaching.  When I became a software engineer, I worked with C# and learned some of the object oriented principles.  Later, F# provided me with the opportunity of blending some of my Math experience into my .NET experience.  It now looks like I may be able to go full circle back to Mathematics with the Haskell programming language.  It appears to be the pinnacle functional programming language with its functional purity.  

Let's dive in.

## Setup

Find the latest version of "The Glasgow Haskell Compiler."  As of 9/18/19, it can be found here, https://www.haskell.org/downloads/. 

**TODO:** Install Windows Platform Version
