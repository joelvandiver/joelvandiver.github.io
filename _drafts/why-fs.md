# Why F#?

I became a .NET developer after I taught high school Math for several years.  I also spent sometime as a Physics major in college.  I've always gravitated towards the simmplicity of Mathematics.  

## Imperative Code 

After gaining some level competence in C#, I began to explore the more Math-*like* qualities of .NET programming.  In fact, the hardest time I had with C# was with the non-Math-*like* aspects.  

For example, I remember having to cross the mental hurdle of mutation.  The code base I was reviewing called a method and returned nothing.  What purpose could a function have if it didn't return anything.  And, to make matters even more confusing, the method's side effect was to mutate the object in memory only.  This felt like magic to me, but not the delightful kind of magic...more like the magic that brought terror.  How could I predict what was going on in the system that changed itself through the call stack?  Well, here's the kicker, I would have to read the code to fully understand the command line after line.  That's my informal definition of "Imperative Code".  There has to be a better way. 

## Functional Code

  I was already pulling many F#-*like* concepts into my C# code such as:

1. Immutability
2. Passing functions as values
3. Method chainging

I was also greatly attracted to the succinctness of F#.
